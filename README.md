Supplement material for poster presentation "Implications of a realistic crustal rheology for Venusâ€™ resurfacing history and global tectonics" at EPSC 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2021-484)

As we reran the reference model(M0) with the same parameters, the results displayed here is a bit different from preliminary results in the abstract: there are also global and regional overturns in the results here, but the timings for overturns are different (not at 1.65 and 2.61 Ga in the abstract). Also, the patterns for mobility are different, but both show a high and continous mobility when plagioclase rheology is applied to the basaltic crust.
